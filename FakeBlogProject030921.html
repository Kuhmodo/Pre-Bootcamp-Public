            Welcome to my page. What can I say? It's been a crazy past year so far.<br> 
            2020 was the worst. Amiright? However, we're in 2021 and it's my year! <br> 
            (technically I'm android 21 and that's why I said that, but semantecs...<br> 
            Anywho, so what's new? Well the world is opening back up slowly, but surely, <br> 
            and I'm on a misson to become perfect before 2022 hits! It requires a healthy diet<br>  
            of huma- I mean nutrients. I'm gonna take home the title of the Cell Games! Watch!<br>
